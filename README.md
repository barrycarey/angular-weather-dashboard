# Home Weather Dashboard

This is a basic dashboard built with Angular CLI. 

It uses your IP to get your location.  It will soon offer the ability to set your location manually. 

It uses data from the Dark Sky API.  Dark Sky does not allow CORs so you will need to setup a web server (ie. Node) to make the requests to Dark Sky.
